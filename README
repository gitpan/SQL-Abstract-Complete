SQL::Abstract::Complete - Generate complete SQL from Perl data structures

This module was inspired by the excellent SQL::Abstract, from which in
inherits. However, in trying to use the module, I found that what I really
wanted to do was generate complete SELECT statements including joins and group
by clauses. So, I set out to create a more complete abstract SQL generation
module. (To be fair, SQL::Abstract kept it's first $table argument
inflexible for backwards compatibility reasons.)

This module only changes the select() method and adds a small new wrinkle to
new(). Everything else from SQL::Abstract is inheritted as-is. Consequently,
you should read the SQL::Abstract documentation before continuing.
